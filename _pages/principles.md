A list of principles, organized into categories, in no particular order. Very few of these are originally mine, but I haven't tracked attribution.

### Epistemology & Cognition

- The map is not the territory.
- Curiosity is the First Virtue
- Everything that can be destroyed by truth, shall be
- Context is that which is scarce
  - Keep building deeper and longer context by focusing on the same topics
- Plain text is more conducive to deep reasoning than rich media
- You can get more mileage from thinking than just being smart
- Scrolling and reading too much drowns out your inner voice.
- Have Will to Think
  - Eg: put energy into thinking deeply
- Do your homework - be the most prepared person in the room
- Profound insight come from focusing intently on the smallest details
  - e.g.: go deeper, narrower, or simpler with all ideas, projects, etc
- Minimize number of areas where to specialize
- It's possible to know more than anyone else on a topic
- It's possible to become a world expert in a niche topic in months or years
- The most interesting people are the most interested
- Go back to the future: use past predictions to understand the future
- Introspection promotes Inaction
  - Introspection is important, but during times of high agency it can be counter-productive. Introspective people already have contemplated many scenarios and should be able to trust their gut during a critical period.
- AI is an intelligence amplifier, your output is proportional to your input

### Agency & Optimization

- Solve for freedom: complete autonomy of one's schedule
- Take responsibility so agency is within
- Action precedes motivation.
- Vision without execution is hallucination, Edison
- [[Speed is THE primary business strategy]]
- Relentless force applied consistently
- Uncomfortable activity leads to growth.
  - Comfort leads to stagnation.
- Use world entanglement as a forcing functions to accomplish things
  - e.g.: commit to public speaking, workshops/conferences, exercise with friends
- Pursue visions
- "Make no little plans; they have no magic to stir men's blood." Daniel Burnham
- "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." Ralph Waldo Emerson
  - An agentic individual is someone who takes an active role in shaping their life, making choices, and pursuing goals rather than passively reacting to circumstances.
- Run your own race
- Be comfortable with low status - avoid status games
- Keep your identity small
- Put yourself in environments where you have to perform to your utmost
- Maximize your amplitude
  - Double down when you feel energized and intentionally rest when drained
- Do hard things, do your thing, do it for decades
  - [[Live an Asymmetric life]]
- Try new things regularly
  - "You won't conquer the oceans if you stay within sight of the shore."
- Relentless is really hard to compete with.
- Build a life. Don't run away from it.
- You don't do anyone any favors by lurking, put yourself out there!
- You can just do things.
- Action produces information.

### Decision Theory & Strategy

- Conditional probabilities are not in your favor
  - e.g.: if selecting for wealth, parenting quality will go down
- Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity, Seneca
- Increase surface area of luck
- Skill is knowing when you've gotten lucky
- Outcomes are correlated to luck inversely to its dependence on skill
  - Eg: beating you at a game of chess is probably skill, beating you at a hand of poker is luck
- The efficient market hypothesis is a lie
- Never ever ever lose at the finish line. Win all deals.
- Cutting losses quickly is the foremost rule of speculating
  - Set a stop‑loss at e.g. -5% but wait a month to avoid wash rule
- Folding (as in poker) is only a small mistake
- What can go right: avoid cynicism and focus on the positives.
- Look under every rock: have obsessive exhaustive behavior to find opportunities.
- A hurt ego can lead to greatness
- Some people do well during struggle
- When you first feel like quitting, go a bit longer, and then re‑evaluate
- If you're split on a difficult decision take the path more difficult in the short term
- Fear is almost always a reason to lean in
- Serendipity lottery tickets eventually pay off
  - The idea of always leaving enough slack/budget for exploring the unknown
- Put yourself in positions where new things will happen to you

### Social Dynamics & Coordination

- Trust is the greatest economic force
- Culture is the worst behavior that you tolerate
- Culture is what happens on the margins
- Find your people: only talk to 10s and the occasional 9
  - Work with people you really respect
  - There are some people who, after you talk to them, you feel more energized and you want to conquer the world or climb a mountain.
- Good relationships require high expectations and high support
- Trust is consistency over time
- Your network is your net‑worth
- Be the person called when others are in the thick of it
- Authentic self‑promotion through education
- Move up the quality curve
- Benefiting others from my surplus
- Give people a good "user experience" when they interact with you.
- Show up. Go to where the action is.
  - E.g.: sign up for random events and conferences even if you have to travel
- Find people you love. Then do life with them
- Most important thing is winning and winning requires leadership
- Best advice givers only give advice when asked
- The calling of a leader is to put themselves out of a job
- Invade an institution and take over from within
  - How people amassed incredible power
- Destroy your enemy, Totally
- Build enduring institutions
- The youth pushes, the wise steer
- Be an instigator
  - In the context of causing things to happen which otherwise wouldn’t happen. This is something that comes naturally to me.

### Resource Allocation & Capital

- "Market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term", Ben Graham
- The more you know the less you diversify
  - Most people are ignorant and don't diversify enough
  - Build wealth by owning a lot of a great asset
- Losers average losers
  - On dollar cost averaging stocks on the way down
- It's not just what you buy, what you pay counts.
- Good investing doesn't come from buying good things, but from buying things well.
- There's no asset so good that it can't become overpriced and thus dangerous, and there are few assets so bad that they can't get cheap enough to be a bargain.
- Time is the denominator: a week is 2% of the year
- Stock compensation is a way to "borrow" from employees.
- A lot of wealth is made through deal‑making between private parties
  - Private is better than public (mark to market is distracting)
- For new tech invest early, for mature tech invest late
- A lot of wealth is generated during periods of multiple expansion (1999, 2021)
- Feeling sadness after a bad trade trains emotional resilience and deeper learning through the limbic system.
- Venture capital is an access (not asset) class
- Self-made wealth signals competence
- Life begins with more time than money; and ends with more money than time.
- Invest time with purpose and meaning
- Pay attention to your production/consumption balance. If you're only consuming and not producing, fix that.
- Do a review of your year
  - Every year, write it out, figure out what was good and what was bad, use this to make your goals for the next year.
- Doing as much as you can every day is a form of life extension.
- Talent is the best asset class
- Own companies and hold them forever
- Invest early in people you know and where you share values

### Systems Thinking & Emergence

- The purpose of a system is what it does
  - (there was a debate about this on ACX, but it still resonates with me)
- Technological advancements that enhance resource use efficiency often lead to higher, not lower, consumption.- Jevons' Paradox.
  - demand for compute, like energy, can be infinitely high at low enough prices
- Software was a layer below humans; now software will be in the same layer as humans
- "The future is already here, it's just not evenly distributed". William Gibson
- Move to where the action is. Agglomeration effects are powerful.
- The best way to predict the future is to invent it
- Consider problems that don't have a clear cost function (e.g. generative AI)
- Productivity as measured by GDP ignores important factors.
  - Phone/elevator operators added no value. Less wasted time everywhere.
- "I just don't change jobs" - Jensen Huang
  - I think there is an idea here where one continues to expand instead of quitting and having to restart. I don't think this means to stay on the same job forever. But perhaps is about waiting for an inbound opportunity instead of looking to leave.
- Customers want fewer vendors
- Start with the Demo

### Personal Philosophy & Meaning

- Pursue radical work‑life integration
- Be in flow by doing things for their own sake.
- Find your duty and do it without fretting about the outcome
- "The meaning of life is to find your gift and the purpose is to give it away", Picasso
- It's much easier to work on things that are exciting to you.
  - Follow your compulsion
- Desire is a contract you make with yourself to be unhappy until you succeed.
- Happiness means to be content. Success requires dissatisfaction. Pick one.
- Hedonistic freedom won't bring you happiness.
- Amor Fati: love one's destiny / fate.
- Find the bottomless well within.
- I'm the main character of my own life, and that's okay.
- Life is an adventure of self‑discovery.

- "I am not done", John Maeda
- "Divine discontent with our performance", Ogilvy
- We live in an age of infinite leverage, so you have to strive to be the best.
- The world is a museum of passion projects.
  - How much tenacity _everything_ requires. That hotel, that park, that railway.
- Your dream has to be externally focused – service, rather than self serving
- Your attitude determines your attitude.
- Make familiar things strange
  - Avoid daily life becoming uninteresting. Make the usual salient.
- Decide if you want to be ADDish or Focused
  - Modern technology is making all of us more ADDish, but what is your self image?
  - An investor has a very ADDish routine (manager schedule), a founder less so.
- It can be helpful to think of our anti-virtues as diseases or disabilities
  - "I have the envy disease" gives us permission to be compassionate to ourselves
- Don't believe everything you think.
