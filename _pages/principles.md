A list of principles, organized into categories, in no particular order. Very few of these are originally mine, but I haven't tracked attribution.

- The most interesting people are the most interested
- Everything that can be destroyed by truth, shall be
- Do your homework - be the most prepared person in the room
- You can get more mileage from thinking than just being smart
- Context is that which is scarce
  - Keep building deeper and longer context by focusing on the same topics
- Plain text is more conducive to deep reasoning than rich media
- Put yourself in environments where you have to perform to your utmost
- The world is a museum of passion projects.
  - How much tenacity _everything_ requires. That hotel, that park, that railway.
- Doing as much as you can every day is a form of life extension.
- Pay attention to your production/consumption balance. If you’re only consuming and not producing, fix that.
- Do a review of your year, every year, write it out, figure out what was good and what was bad, use this to make your goals for the next year.
- "Do not go where the path may lead, go instead where there is no path and leave a trail." Ralph Waldo Emerson
  - An agentic individual is someone who takes an active role in shaping their life, making choices, and pursuing goals rather than passively reacting to circumstances.

- Run your own race
- Be comfortable with low status - avoid status games
- Keep your identity small
- Action precedes motivation.
- Your dream has to be externally focused – service, rather than self serving
- Your attitude determines your attitude

### Relationships

- Your network is your net‑worth
- Find your people: only talk to 10s and the occasional 9
  - Work with people you really respect
  - There are some people who, after you talk to them, you feel more energized and you want to conquer the world or climb a mountain or something.
- Be the person called when others are in the thick of it
- Authentic self‑promotion through education
- Trust is the greatest economic force
- Move up the quality curve
- Benefiting others from my surplus
- Give people a good “user experience” when they interact with you.

  - E.g.: sign up for random events and conferences even if you have to travel
- Good relationships require high expectations and high support
- Find people you love. Then do life with them
- Trust is consistency over time
- Culture is the worst behavior that you tolerate
- Culture is what happens on the margins

- Invade an institution and take over from within
  - How people amassed incredible power
- Destroy your enemy, Totally
- Speed is THE primary business strategy
- Build enduring institutions

### Wealth

- Market is a voting machine in the short term and a weighing machine in the long term - Ben Graham
- Losers average losers
  - On dollar cost averaging stocks on the way down
- Cutting losses quickly is the foremost rule of speculating
  - Set a stop‑loss at e.g. -5% but wait a month to avoid wash rule
- Folding (as in poker) is only a small mistake
- Go back to the future: use past predictions to understand the future
- The efficient market hypothesis is a lie
- A lot of wealth is made through deal‑making between private parties
- The more you know the less you diversify
  - Most people are ignorant and don't diversify enough
- What can go right: avoid cynicism and focus on the positives.
- Look under every rock: have obsessive exhaustive behavior to find opportunities.
- Never ever ever lose at the finish line. Win all deals.
- For new tech invest early, for mature tech invest late
- A lot of wealth is generated during periods of multiple expansion (1999, 2021)
- Feeling sadness after a bad trade trains emotional resilience and deeper learning through the limbic system.
- Stock compensation is a way to "borrow" from employees.
- It’s not just what you buy, what you pay counts.
- Good investing doesn’t come from buying good things, but from buying things well.
- There’s no asset so good that it can’t become overpriced and thus dangerous, and there are few assets so bad that they can’t get cheap enough to be a bargain.
- Increase surface area of luck
- Skill is knowing when you’ve gotten lucky
- Outcomes are correlated to luck inversely to its dependence on skill
  - Eg: beating you at a game of chess is probably skill, beating you at a hand of poker is luck

### Systems

- Technological advancements that enhance resource use efficiency often lead to higher, not lower, consumption.- Jevons' Paradox.
  - demand for compute, like energy, can be infinitely high at low enough prices
- Consider problems that don't have a clear cost function (e.g. generative AI)
- Software was a layer below humans; now software will be in the same layer as humans
- Productivity as measured by GDP ignores important factors.
  - Phone/elevator operators added no value. Less wasted time everywhere.
- The future is already here, it’s just not evenly distributed.—William Gibson
- The purpose of a system is what it does
- The best way to predict the future is to invent it
- Conditional probabilities are not in your favor
  - e.g.: if selecting for wealth, parenting quality will go down
- Luck Is What Happens When Preparation Meets Opportunity, Seneca
- Move to where the action is. Agglomeration effects are powerful.
- "I just don't change jobs" - Jensen Huang
  - I think there is an idea here where one continues to expand instead of quitting and having to restart. I don't think this means to stay on the same job forever. But perhaps is about waiting for an inbound opportunity instead of looking to leave.
- Do hard things, do your thing, do it for decades
  - Live an Asymmetric life
- Try new things regularly
  - "You won't conquer the oceans if you stay within sight of the shore."
- Relentless is really hard to compete with.
- A hurt ego can lead to greatness
- When you first feel like quitting, go a bit longer, and then re‑evaluate
- Build a life. Don't run away from it.
- You don’t do anyone any favors by lurking, put yourself out there!
