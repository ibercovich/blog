A list of recommendations to make life easier.

**Fitness**

- Have a wrist rest to avoid carpal tunnel.
- Have a stand-up desk.
- Exercise regularly.
- Always pick hotels with gyms.
- Spend money on a good mattress and pillows.
- Use a smart watch, ideally with long battery life, such as Garmin.

**Oral Health**

- Use an electric toothbrush, and floss.
- Get a mouthguard and save your enamel. You probably grind your teeth.
- Try sodium fluoride toothpastes. In general, try different toothpastes to find something that doesn’t irritate.
- Don’t undergo procedures that remove enamel unless you have to. Try remineralization first.

**Skin Health**

- Wear sunglasses.
- Check UV index before leaving your home.
- Grow a beard.
- Wear clothes that cover your skin.
- Wear sunscreen.
- Wear a full brim hat, like a Panama hat.
- Ease yourself into the summer months. Let your skin produce melanin (adds ~2 SPF).
- Pick soft natural fibers for clothes and sheets, stretchy when possible.
- Wear soft and comfortable fabrics. Clothes don't need to be itchy.
- Walk and sit in the shade when possible.
- Start using topical Minoxidil as soon as hair starts receding.
- Detergent perfumes and fabric conditioners might make you itchy—use fragrance-free products whenever possible.
- Bring your own soap and shampoo when you travel.

**Nutrition**

- Chemical-free decaf coffee is available almost everywhere. It tastes the same, without the stimulant.
- Pay attention to how you react to different foods. Do you get constipated? De-energized? Gassy? Stinky?
- Weigh yourself daily.
- Avoid sugar, especially refined sugar whenever possible.
- Go to the farmers' market. You will discover many new varieties of fruit and vegetables.
- Use ceramic-based non-stick pans. Replace them when they become sticky.
- Try intermittent fasting. Skipping breakfast is easy.
- Explore a lot of different snacks until you find some that are tasty and healthy. Always stay stocked so you don’t fall for junk.
- Eat at home more often.
- It's okay to eat the same easy/healthy/tasty meal frequently.

**Convenience**

- Buy a bidet.
- Use baby wipes for traveling, ideally flushable and biodegradable.
- Cut your hair at home with an electric trimmer. Save time and money.
- Become an effective calendar user, both professionally and socially.
- Consumer hardware for hair removal actually works.
- Trim armpits. No downsides, less stinky.

**Air Quality**

- Use induction cooktops.
- When in doubt, wear a mask (e.g., spray-painting).

**Sleep**

- Use the bedroom for sleeping only. Watch TV in the living room.
- Have tunable lightbulbs that switch to a red hue in the evenings.
- Have dimmable lights that are kept low in the evening.
- Use night mode on all your screens.
- Consider white point reduction on the phone.
- Try a vibrating wristwatch alarm for a less violent awakening.
- Wake up at the same time every day.
