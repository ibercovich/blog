## Industry Experience

### Graphiq (2011-2017)

Led the architecture and scaling of Graphiq's Knowledge Graph, building an ontology of 1.7 billion entities, 285 billion data points, and roughly 1.5 trillion relationships across hundreds of domains. The core technical challenge involved creating automated ETL infrastructure that non-engineers could operate autonomously, integrating over 1,200 data sources while processing 300 million daily updates. What previously took years to ingest and publish was compressed to weeks or minutes.

Built a natural language question-answering system using bottoms-up semantic parsing over the structured Knowledge Graph. By sequentially combining NER, intent extraction, and NLG templating, we translated text queries into database operations with auto-generated visualizations. Through distributed database optimization and automated indexing, maintained 150-200ms response times at 25,000 queries per second. Internal benchmarks showed higher accuracy than Amazon Alexa and Google on standard query batteries.
