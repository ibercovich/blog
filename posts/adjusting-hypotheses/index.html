			<p>I recently experienced a pattern-recognition failure, which inspired some thoughts about machine intelligence. Arriving at a T hallway intersection at a hotel, I glanced at the following sign:</p>
<p>[ <strong>→ Elevators</strong> ]</p>
<p>My automatic response was to veer towards the left side. As I was turning, something &ldquo;felt&rdquo; wrong, similar to the discomfort experienced when reading a misspelled word. This prompted me to pause and this time read the sign more carefully, thus revealing that the elevators where in fact located to my right. Adding to the mystery, my companions were also similarly affected. Upon further reflection it became evident that in a typical setting, a left and right arrows would be presented in the left [ <strong>← Elevators</strong>  ] and right  [  <strong>Elevators →</strong> ] side of the text respectively.</p>
<p>My battle-tested mental model therefore associated direction with the position of the symbol, more so than the symbol itself (though it didn't help that arrows are not highly distinctive). I would have been equally convinced, had I seen [ <strong>★ Elevators</strong> ] or [ <strong>◨ Elevators</strong> ].</p>
<p>Humans developing simple models that deliver high recall and precision is not surprising. A machine trained model might behave similarly. What I find interesting is my ability to develop a hypothesis (&ldquo;turn left&rdquo;), immediately followed by seemingly baseless hesitation, prompting me to increase my sensing bandwidth (looking carefully) and re-evaluating my decision (&ldquo;turn right&rdquo;).  Something special is happening in the mind, which goes beyond basic hierarchical thinking. My wet neural network does not output an answer (&ldquo;left&rdquo; or &ldquo;right&rdquo;). Rather, there is a back-propagation-like memory linkage between the present situation and previously successful interpretation tactics. The available tactics are ranked, possibly based on interpretative ROI. Finally, each tactic is evaluated on the fly, yielding some confidence level. Scoring below a certain threshold triggers additional brain cycles to re-evaluate.</p>
<p>This type of thinking does not feel like a single model, regardless of complexity. A multi-component system with various orchestration mechanisms is at play. Call it softwetware or state machine, but it's not just data/memory.</p>
