I recently discovered an [article on overemployment](https://www.businessinsider.com/overemployed-workers-secret-two-multiple-jobs-salaries-tech-tips-2023-11), a term referring to holding multiple full-time jobs secretly. While some, often low-income individuals, juggle multiple part-time roles out of necessity, overemployment typically involves individuals in remote, white-collar, often tech-based, roles. The article portrays these employees positively, as exceptionally productive. I see it differently.

In my managerial experience, I've often contemplated the balance between input and output. Fundamentally, output is what counts. Companies value the results their employees produce, prioritizing high performers regardless of their commitment level. Culturally, focusing on results rather than time spent is preferable, creating a less intrusive work environment.

Yet, those experienced in managing diverse teams know this view is overly simplistic. For non-repetitive, creative tasks, results aren't always measurable weekly. Complex tasks require iteration, with results appearing intermittently. While end results are crucial, they are preceded by significant effort and dedication â€“ the input. This might sound complex, but it's logical. Consider the Manhattan Project; its success wouldn't have been possible if team members were splitting their focus with other jobs.

A leader's role is to foster a productive work environment, involving hiring the right people, promoting a positive culture, setting unified team objectives, and more. Ironically, an excessive focus on quantifying results, while avoiding input metrics, can lead to an uncreative and stressful workplace. In such settings, employees become risk-averse, engage in unnecessary debates about task sizing and assignment, and innovation suffers.

Conversely, in an organization filled with dedicated individuals, input metrics become irrelevant. Everyone is focused on achieving challenging goals, knowing not all efforts will be successful. In such cultures, innovation often occurs outside traditional work hours and settings. A committed environment like this doesn't obsess over employees' comings and goings but requires daily dedication to maintain.

When teams view their work as mere transactions, the culture deteriorates. Leaders must promote behaviors that foster a non-transactional environment. Employees with multiple full-time jobs inherently challenge this culture and should be discouraged.
