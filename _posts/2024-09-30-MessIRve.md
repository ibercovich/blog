Together with Francisco Valentini, Viviana Cotik, Damián Ariel Furman, Edgar Altszyler, PhD, Juan Manuel Pérez, we're happy to announce the release of MessIRve, a new large-scale IR dataset in Spanish!

MessIRve contains around 730k queries from 20 Spanish-speaking countriesand the United States, with relevant documents sourced from Wikipedia. MessIRve's queries reflect diverse Spanish-speaking regions, unlike other datasets that are translated from English or do not consider dialectal variations. The large size of the dataset allows it to cover a wide variety of topics, unlike smaller datasets.

The dataset is available in HuggingFace!

Queries and relevance judgments: https://lnkd.in/g28YdNSN
The collection of documents: spanish-ir/eswiki_20240401_corpus
Queries and qrels in TREC format: spanish-ir/messirve-trec
For more details, check out our arXiv paper: MessIRve: A Large-Scale Spanish Information Retrieval Dataset ( https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05994 )

We hope MessIRve serves to spur more work in IR for the Spanish language and facilitate the development of efficient information access tools for Spanish speakers.

- MessIRve means works for me in Spanish ("me sirve"). The reference to Lionel Messi, player of the most popular sport in Spanish-speaking countries, football, stresses the importance of using topics that are relevant to Spanish speakers.
