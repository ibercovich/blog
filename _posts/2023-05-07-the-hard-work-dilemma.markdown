# The Hard Work Dilemma #

![](/assets/two-worlds-dilemma.png)

During a recent conversation with a colleague, we discussed the idea of work ethics and the impact they have on personal and professional development. This is a subject that has arisen frequently throughout my career in management, and it's one that I find both intriguing and challenging.

I've noticed that individuals tend to fall on a wide spectrum when it comes to work ethics. Some are highly committed to their work, while others are more nonchalant about it. As a manager, it can be difficult to guide those who seem to be caught in the middle, struggling with a kind of cognitive dissonance. They may feel that society places too much emphasis on hard work and dedication, yet they also want the rewards that come with a strong commitment to their careers.

I remember a particular conversation, at Amazon, in which someone expressed that they didn't prioritize work as much as the average employee. My response was that everyone has different priorities, and that's fine. However, their counter argument was that this creates an unfair advantage for those who choose to invest more time and energy in their work. When I half-jokingly suggested that we enforce a strict 5 pm cutoff time for all employees to level the playing field, they actually agreed, which would be an oppressive restriction for others.

The root of this issue, I believe, lies in the tendency for people to view work in a purely transactional manner. It's true that a job is fundamentally a transaction, with employees providing services in exchange for compensation. However, this narrow perspective overlooks the broader concept of work - the tasks and efforts we engage in outside of our professional lives, often without any monetary reward.

People might spend countless hours planning a wedding, helping a friend in need, or taking care of their children - all forms of work that don't come with a paycheck. And yet, when it comes to their jobs, these same individuals may display a lack of enthusiasm or commitment to the quality of their work. This is somewhat paradoxical, as one might expect that the addition of financial incentives would lead to even greater dedication.

Of course, not all jobs are enjoyable, and there are undoubtedly tasks that we'd rather avoid. Even so, we willingly undertake unpaid work like changing diapers or taking out the trash. Moreover, many of the people I've managed have enjoyed working conditions that are far better than those experienced by the vast majority of the global population. It seems that there's a psychological resistance to performing tasks out of necessity or obligation, as opposed to genuinely wanting to do them.

I find it curious that many individuals strive for competence and efficiency when assisting a friend or handling a family crisis, yet choose to be lackluster or even incompetent in their professional lives. This isn't about working longer hours or putting oneself at a disadvantage; it's about the decision to expend the same amount of energy on doing a task poorly as one would on doing it well.

My suggestion is to adopt a dual approach to one's job. Most of the time, focus on doing good work, regardless of pay, management, or company mission. Strive to excel at the tasks at hand and learn as much as possible in the process. Periodically, perhaps twice a year, step back and evaluate the overall satisfaction with your job, including compensation, relationships with coworkers, and other factors. If this reflection reveals a desire for change, pursue it. If not, continue to do good work.

While I can only speak from my own experience, I believe that, all else being equal, a commitment to doing great work will lead to greater happiness and success in the long run for most employees.
