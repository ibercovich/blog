- Proof of work is the notion in cryptocurrencies that in order to participate in the network, a node has to spend resources solving complex computational problems.

- It doesn't matter who is running the node or where they are located, because they broadcast their qualifications through proof of work.

- The market for human talent has similar, albeit fuzzier, signals.

- Having an Ivy League degree "proves" some sort of prior competence.

- Same with working at a top company.

- Same with being part of any network of competent people (warm leads, referrals).

- People have always had a sense that the above were rigged. That there was more nepotism and less social mobility in the system than it showed.

- Technology was attractive because it allowed people without traditional forms of social proof to show their talent directly by solving difficult problems with the use of tech.

- Two software developers could raise a little money from friends and family to build an impressive prototype, and that would be sufficient evidence for them to raise capital from VCs and make it big.

- But this proof of work is becoming weaker evidence.

- At the beginning of the arc of digital technology, say, Steve Wozniak designing and building the first Apple computers, this was incontrovertible evidence.

- But since then, developing technology has become easier.

- More and more people go to college for computer science. Developer tools and open-source software are amazing. There are highly leverageable platforms like the internet, mobile, etc., and infrastructure for rent in the cloud.

- In the 70s, there was probably an undersupply of technology companies because it was too hard.

- The Y Combinator era of 2005â€“2020 might have been the golden age of digital startups.

- Platforms, infrastructure, capital, and founders came together for an explosion in startup value creation.

- Startups from the golden era were still capable of building large monopolies and achieving high gross margins.

- Now with AI, it seems it's becoming too easy to start a technology company.

- If it's the case that it becomes too easy to start a company, then proof of work goes away.

- It becomes harder to determine which founders deserve to be funded, because they all have some product, and even revenue.

- They get revenue in part by customers attributing innovation credit to founders when they should pass it through to OpenAI and others.

- Because it's easy, there is rapid fragmentation.

- Many hustlers that before would have become realtors are now looking to build niche software businesses.

- But if that's the case, then at least part of the software ecosystem starts to look like traditional businesses: a trucking company, a restaurant, a retail shop.

- VC capital is looking for companies that will conquer an entire market.

- Does this mean determining competence for tech founders acquires a flavor of times past, looking at pedigree and such?

- In part, yes. We need evidence of competence, and since prototypes don't mean much, other signals become stronger.

- This might work for people who cut their teeth before LLMs.

- Now people are using LLMs to get through college, and to do their fancy company jobs, so those signals are also weakening.

- I think it's more important than ever to find ways to show hard evidence of competence.

- Maybe there will be an SAT for adults that everyone takes, or employers will start asking for IQ or psychometric tests.

- Perhaps there will be new institutions that arise to satisfy this need.

- My answer has been to focus on raw intellect. Of course, my perception is subjective, but I've interviewed thousands of people and managed hundreds, and I think I'm a decent scout of raw talent.

- One thing that is interesting is that it's easier to detect raw capability in a younger person, because sometimes experience can look like talent.

- I expect a new wave of precocious founders that will somewhat reverse the trend of more experienced serial SaaS founders.

- Beyond that, I still have more questions than answers.
