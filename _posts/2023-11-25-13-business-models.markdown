## Open Source Ecosystem 

### Model Overview
Leveraging the Open Source model, businesses initiate projects with the intent to cultivate a community that contributes to and utilizes the software. Monetization strategies can include offering premium services or cloud solutions. An alternative approach involves creating tools that enhance the value of existing open-source projects. 

### Key Considerations
- **Customer Profile**: Highly technical, demanding a product that is community-driven and widely adopted.
