In venture investing, an antiportfolio is the most successful companies we could have invested in, but passed.

I was thinking about this topic more broadly. What are some life decisions that I contemplated but ultimately made the wrong choice.

It's important to be aware of our errors of omission, especially the ones that form a pattern. So we can avoid similar mistakes in the future.

This doesn't list errors of commission, for example when I bought overpriced tech stocks all the way down in 2022.

- Not being more involved with math and computer olympiads
- Not repeating last year of highschool
- Not applying to more colleges
- Not starting to invest earlier
- Not applying to more than just Berkeley for transfer
- Not going to Stanford or Cornell
- Not paying more attention to BTC in 2010 (in fact, I had several BTC for $1 each, which my friend sent me, and lost them)
- Not investing in NVIDIA when I first learned of CUDA in 2015 at $0.5 (split adjusted)
- Not going all in on AI when I learned of Word2Vec
- Not keeping a few thousand dollars $2000-$5000 in BTC in Coinbase at $200 ( $1M - $2.5M)
- Not making an aggressive push for director at Amazon when I had the scope, results, and leverage
- Selling a property in 2018 to buy another property in cash because my wife didn't want a mortgage (should have kept both)
- Buying $50k of Tesla at $17 in 2018, then immediately selling because my wife thought Elon had a bad moral character and would bankrupt the company
- Investing in NVIDIA, tepidly $50k at $12/share, when I couldn't find cloud GPUs, but then selling during the crypto hype. Theme: should make smart small bets and ride them
- Willingly and proactively giving all my equity in Unwrap to my co-founder, a company I founded and controlled, instead of keeping a nominal amount, 2%-5%
