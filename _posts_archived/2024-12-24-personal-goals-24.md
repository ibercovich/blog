This document summarizes my goals for the year 2024. The goals themselves are not listed in any particular order, but they are grouped by category. I am doing this for myself. Writing this down forces me to spend a few hours towards the end of the year to reflect on and appreciate everything that I've done.

## Purpose (profession, career, interests)

If I can see myself evolving across many dimensions and see a path forward, I generally feel purposeful. Having things to do, which are also challenging, interesting, and important, gives me purpose.

**The Theme for 2024 was Deep Knowledge**.

**(score A) Contribute to 1 ML Paper** : After attending NeurIPS in 2023 and realizing a lot of the research on display was within my grasp, I became interested in contributing. Initially I thought this was an unlikely goal because since departing my PhD in 2011, I haven't been involved in academia. My objective was to find a project to which I could contribute in some way and become a "baby author" alongside the primary researchers. I found a group of researchers in Argentina who were receptive to this idea and we published [MessIRve: A Large-Scale Spanish Information Retrieval Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05994), led by [Francisco Valentini](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dInKH6kAAAAJ). I look forward to continue on this journey.

**(Score C) 3 Short Side Projects** : I worked in a number of throw away projects of a few hours each, but only [Word2Vec from Scratch](https://ivanbercovich.com/2024/word2vec) met my standards for this goal.

**(Score A) Attend 1-2 AI Academic Conferences** : I attended ICLR in Vienna and NeurIPS in Vancouver. These events are a great way to condense learning (I especially enjoy poster sessions) and make new connections. I would like to keep this pace of 1-2 conferences per year.

**(Score A) Read 10 Used Physical Books** : Last year, I made a commitment to concentrate my feeds into fewer topics and longer form. I signed up for several newsletters which accounts for most of my reading in 2024. However, I still missed the immersive experience of reading more books. I decided on used physical books to increase informational serendipity and reduce overlap with my digital reading. I read 18 books cover to cover and had a few additional false starts.

## Connection (partnership, intimacy, family, friends) & Presence

I appreciate the meaningful connections that Iâ€™ve made throughout my life, including those that were powerful but short lived. Relationships are an important part of life, and I hope my future includes rich experiences with old and new friends. Unfortunately, everyone's circumstances and interests change, and that means relationships that were once fresh and relevant tend to fall into the background. My observation is that most people allocate significant time and energy to maintain relationships that would otherwise go stale, whereas I'm okay with some relationships dissipating and others flourishing organically. Having a lot of time to myself is extremely important. I enjoy spending most of my weekends diving deep into a new topic, usually tech related, or hiking/running/biking. This creates some tension with maintaining casual relationships. I generally prefer social time involving intellectual conversations, shared projects, physical activity, or interesting/new experiences. I believe most people want to separate their personal life (including friends) from work, but for me the ideal friendship is one where there is a high degree of professional intersection. My relationships with family are predicated on the same parameters as other relationships: a history of interactions, common interests, compatible personalities.

**The Theme for 2024 was Vertical-Networking**.

**(Score B) Join SB Club** : I thought it would be interesting to join a members-only club, particularly since my middle class upbringing never offered something of the sort. In practice, it's just a place I can take people to lunch or dinner, mostly for business reasons. I haven't socialized much with members, who on average are much older. It has been nice to invite friends to lunch each month and be the host.
**(Score A) meet 10 new outstanding people (10s)** :
**(Score D) use the phone less often** :
**(Score B) stronger commitments?** :
**(Score B) engage with rationalists**: I've been wanting to connect with more people in the rationalist community and it has become clear this requires traveling. Fortunately it has been easy to find events in San Francisco. The Curve, Vision Weekend, Vibe Camp.

## Fitness (strength, endurance, physiology, nutrition)

I feel better when I eat healthy and exercise. Lately, I've started to pay attention to my aging and experimenting with methods that can soften the transition, such as being more careful with sun exposure and avoiding products that dry my skin. I spent less time exercising this year, around 200 hours. My peak was 2020 at 350 hours.

**The Theme for 2024 was Weightlifting**.

**(Score B) 50 runs, 150 miles** : I barely met the the goal of running once per week, three miles. It ended up being a bit more than once per week, and closer to 2-2.5 miles on average.

**(Score F) 25 bike rides, 350 miles** : I went for 11 rides over 121 miles. Working out has become more transactional and biking requires too much time for the fitness benefit.

**(Score A-) bench 225 lb** : I was able to bench 225 lb, but it's not pretty. As far as weightlifting in general, I give myself **A+**. I'm stronger than ever, particularly when it comes to legs. I can comfortably squat 235 lb, leg press 12 plates, and maxed out the adduction and abduction machines. My weight increased from 145 to 160 lb, and my lab tests improved slightly.

## Experience (travel, adventure, surprise, learning)

As I've accumulated more experiences, life has become more monotonous. While my past self was concerned (even afraid) of eventual monotony, today I appreciate the opportunity to pursue a continually refined routine. Monotony allows me to eat more healthily, exercise more often, waste less time on things I don't deem important, and quickly course-correct if I'm disappointed in myself. However, I also believe it is important to be able to look back and quickly recall important/interesting moments. Due to our brain's ability to constantly improve our pattern recognition, similar experiences are compressed together, becoming hard to recall individually without a relevant queue. On the other hand, novel experiences tend to invade my consciousness even when I'm not seeking them, providing a constant reminder of a life thoroughly lived. To this end, I try to accrue experience outside of my daily routine each year, though with time I've realized these infrequent events are also a routine but at a more macro scale (e.g. try to ski each season).

**The Theme for 2024 was Return to Europe**.

**(Score C) Ski 14 days** : I skied much less. One trip to Salt Lake City with Dave Koifman, and another to Taheo with Georg for his 40th birthday.
**(Score B) LiB** : I went to LiB with Ivgeni, Carrie, the kids, and Georg. I couldn't really get into the mood. I also felt like it was a lot of logistics. Next time I need to find a sprinter van and make it easiest on myself.
**(Score A) Burning Man** : Longest BM for me and best in terms of weather. I went with the Enclave / Pyrobar crew. It wasn't the best match. But I had a good time. I stayed primarily in the city, spending less time chasing big events. Georg and I spent a lot of quality time together.
**Lisbon & Vienna** : This was apparently my last offsite with Voyager, given that I didn't get invited to Colombia in 2025. It was nice to spend some summer time in Europe, even though it rained a bit in Vienna. I got a few days to explore with Max Hassert, who was the first couch surfer I hosted 15 years prior.
**Go on 5 trips** : Lisbon, Vienna, Colo, Telluride, Idaho, white fish, Sierras, Vancouver, New York
**Backpacking Trip** : We went back to the California Sierra Nevada. I was in poor shape. A few of us also had a terrible case of blisters.
**(Score A) Go to OSL w/ Julia** : This was our third OSL. Great on all accounts.
